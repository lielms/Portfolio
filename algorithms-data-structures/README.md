<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project

This project is a data structures assignment that I have improved upon. Originally developed as a Singly Linked List for CS 300, this artifact has been enhanced into a Generic Doubly Linked List library.

The system is designed to handle large datasets (specifically bid data from CSV files) with high efficiency. By implementing a recursive Merge Sort algorithm, the project demonstrates advanced algorithmic principles, moving beyond linear traversal to achieve \(O(n \log n)\) performance.

### :dart: Features

- Generic Templates: The DoublyLinkedList<T> class supports any data type, not just Bids.
- Bi-directional Traversal: Uses prev and next pointers for flexible navigation.
- Efficient Sorting: Integrated Merge Sort providing \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity.\
- Robust CRUD: Support for appending, searching, and safe removal of nodes.
